## About

ATCSim is a desktop application that allows you to simulate the job of being an air traffic controller, such as

- Adding planes to takeoff/landing queues
- Clearing planes for takeoff/landing
- Handling emergencies such as closing runways, the airspace, and the ground

There are also airport managment actions such as
- Assigning and removing planes from gates

Lastly, there are also airline managment actions such as
- Managing your fleet of aircraft (Boeing and Airbus)
- Seeing the stats of your fleet such as how many Boeing 777s are in your fleet
